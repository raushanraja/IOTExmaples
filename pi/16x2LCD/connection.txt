In the steps below the physical/logical numbering of the pins are in the brackets otherwise it’s the GPIO numbering.

1. Place a wire from 5v (Pin 2) to the positive rail on the breadboard.

2. Place a wire from ground (pin 6) to the ground rail on the breadboard.

3. Place the 16×2 display onto the breadboard.

4. Place the potentiometer onto the breadboard.

■ Connect the positive and ground pins to the relevant rails on the breadboard.



Starting from pin 1 of the LCD display do the following or simply refer to the circuit diagram below. Pin 1 of the screen is the pin closest to two edges of the board.

1. Pin 1 (Ground) goes to the ground rail.

2. Pin 2 (VCC/5v) goes to the positive rail.

3. Pin 3 (V0) goes to the middle wire of the potentiometer.

4. Pin 4 (RS) goes to GPIO25 (Pin 22)

5. Pin 5 (RW) goes to the ground rail.

6. Pin 6 (EN) goes to GPIO24 (Pin 18)

7. Pin 11 (D4) goes to GPIO23 (Pin 16)

8. Pin 12 (D5) goes to GPIO17 (Pin 11)

9. Pin 13 (D6) goes to GPIO18 (Pin 12)

10. Pin 14 (D7) goes to GPIO22 (Pin 15)

11. Pin 15 (LED +) goes to the positive rail.

12. Pin 16 (LED -) goes to the ground rail.
